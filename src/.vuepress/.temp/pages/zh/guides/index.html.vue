<p>Welcome to the Guides section of the Kele Pool documentation!
Here you will find various guides that walk you through every step of the various Kele Pool processes.</p>
<p>If you're looking to stake your ETH with Kele Pool and receive rETH in return, please visit the <RouterLink to="/zh/guides/staking/overview.html">Staking Guide</RouterLink>.
Staking is a very simple process, and this guide is filled with step-by-step instructions (including screenshots) that show you how it's done.</p>
<p>If you're interested in running a Kele Pool node to create your own ETH2 validators, take a look at our <RouterLink to="/zh/guides/node/responsibilities.html">Node Operator's guide</RouterLink>.
This is a very comprehensive guide that goes over all of the considerations involved in node operation, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Deciding to run a node locally at home, or remotely on the cloud</li>
<li>Selecting the hardware for a local machine, or selecting a remote hosting provider</li>
<li>Preparing and securing the operating system of your node</li>
<li>Selecting your ETH1 and ETH2 clients</li>
<li>Installing Kele Pool's Smartnode stack</li>
<li>Creating a new ETH2 validator using the Kele Pool network</li>
<li>Maintaining and updating your node</li>
</ul>
<p>Both guides will show you how to practice for free on the Kele Pool testnet so you can get a feel for everything without risking any of your real-life ETH, and how to stake your real ETH on the Ethereum mainnet once you're comfortable with the process.</p>
<p>When you're ready, select a guide from the options above based on your interests.
You are also free to explore the various pages using the sidebar to the left.</p>
