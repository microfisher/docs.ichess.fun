This article will describe how to debug local applications by connecting to the PlatON DevNet(development Network).
There are 2 devnets:

1. Devnet

The Devnet supports two chainids, new: 2203181, old: 210309.

openapi：

https://devnetopenapi2.platon.network/rpc or wss://devnetopenapi2.platon.network/ws
https://devnetopenapi.platon.network/rpc or wss://devnetopenapi.platon.network/ws

faucet：

https://faucet.platon.network/faucet

exployer：

https://devnetscan.platon.network

2. Devnet2

Also supports 2 chainids, new: 2206132, old: 2206131

openapi：

https://devnet2openapi.platon.network/rpc or wss://devnet2openapi.platon.network/ws

faucet：

https://devnet2faucet.platon.network/faucet

exployer：

https://devnet2scan.platon.network


>Note： 
> The purpose of opening up the two development networks is to act as a backup for each other, both being identical in functionality, as the underlying development iteration of the chain needs to reset one of the development networks from time to time to verify new features.
> Please keep an eye on the official information platform for the reset time. The following will introduce how to use the development network using the development 1 network as an example, if you use the development 2 network, please adjust the chain ID and openapi address according to the above information.


## How to access the dev network to debug local applications?

### **Step 1: Connect to the DevNet via RPC address**

```
https://devnetopenapi2.platon.network/rpc or wss://devnetopenapi2.platon.network/ws
https://devnetopenapi.platon.network/rpc or wss://devnetopenapi.platon.network/ws
```

>Note：
>
> - devnetopenapi2.platon.network/rpc returns 2203181
> - devnetopenapi.platon.network/rpc returns 210309
> - devnet2openapi.platon.network/rpc returns 2206132

#### Access method 1:  Connect to the DevNet via the local PlatON node
on the ubuntu 18.04 server, download and install the PlatON binary with the following command:
```bash
sudo wget https://download.platon.network/platon/platon/1.2.1/platon -P /usr/bin    
```
Connect to the development network by.
```bash
platon attach https://devnetopenapi2.platon.network/rpc
```

#### Access method 2: Connect to the PlatON DevNet through the SDKs

- Use the [Java SDK](/docs/en/Java_SDK) to connect to the DevNet, for example, as follows.
```java
Web3j platonWeb3j = Web3j.build(new HttpService("https://devnetopenapi2.platon.network/rpc"));
```
- Use [Python SDK](/docs/en/Python_SDK) to access the DevNet, the example is as follows.
```python
w3 = Web3(HTTPProvider("https://devnetopenapi2.platon.network/rpc"))
```
- Use [JS SDK](/docs/en/JS_SDK) to access the DevNet, the example is as follows.
```js
var Web3 = require('web3');
var web3 = new Web3('http://https://devnetopenapi2.platon.network/rpc');
```
- Using [JSON RPC](/docs/en/Json_Rpc) to access the DevNet, the example is as follows.
```curl
curl -X POST -H 'content-type: application/json' --data '{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "method": "web3_clientVersion", "params":[], "id":67}' https://devnetopenapi2.platon.network/rpc
```

Not limited to the above language SDKs, you also have access through SDKs in other languages.

### **Step 2: Apply for DevNet Test Token**

If you are in the Dev 1 network.Click [faucet](https://faucet.platon.network/faucet/) to receive the Test Token. If you have a large Test Token request, please send an email to support@latticex.foundation using the following format.
```
 Title: PlatON Development Network （1or2）Token Request
 Your Name:
 Contact information：
 Wechart ID (or other instant messaging software)：
 Amount：
 Use：
 Receiving addressA:
 Remarks:
```

After successfully accessing the DevNet 1, you can send transactions after completing the test Token collection to start your test journey and can check the transactions in [DevNet Browser](https://devnetscan.platon.network).
If the access is to the dev2.com, please click on [tap](https://devnet2faucet.platon.network/faucet/) to receive the test Token, and you can check the transaction at [DevNet Browser](https://devnet2scan.platon.network).
